## Sauce Labs API Testing Resources

<br>

 A centralised and collaborative environment with tools to quickly generate functional and end-to-end API tests, deploy a mocking server that mimics a real API server's calls and responses, and load test your endpoints.

- [Contract Testing][api-contract]  
- [Mocking][api-mock]  
- [Load Testing][api-load-docs]
  - [Load Testing Tutorial][api-load-tutorial]

<br>

The API [_Testing Composer_][api-composer] provides an environment to automatically generate tests, code them from scratch, or import them from a spec file. Enhance your tests with four powerful _component_ types and JavaScript support.

- [I/O][api-composer-io] — GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- [Assert][api-composer-assert] — Compare, Contains, Exists, Is
- [Logic][api-composer-logic] — Loops, Conditionals
- [Fn][api-composer-fn] — Flow, Fact, Fake, and more!

<br>


Once you've written a few tests, use [_API methods_][api-methods] and the [_apictl_][api-ctl] tool to automate your workflows and integrate them into a pipeline.
